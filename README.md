Pensiv is a realtime thoughtstreaming app.  There's no particular organization to how, when, or where we have great or important ideas.  Pensiv is the only platform robust enough to always be there when you need it.

Here's how it works:
Whenever you have an idea, publish it into your Pensiv thoughtstream.  Categorize all your thoughts by hashtag so you can search through them later, either on your mobile device or the web platform (*in development).  

Here's some typical thoughts entered into Pensiv:
 - "#idea app that turns any photo into Impressionistic painting"
 - "#todo email Jeremy back about that Apple internship"
 - "#event Emberjs developer meetup on Thurs"
 - "#person Libby, met at MIT mystery hunt, works in Course 9 lab"


Pensiv is built using Meteor primarily, so the entire app is fully realtime, has a MongoDB backend, uses HandlebarsJS for the templating system, and consists of only a single JS and single HTML file. I also used Ionic for various DOM components.  I am planning to use Swipejs to implement multitouch functionality on mobile devices.
